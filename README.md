# E-commerce Back End 

## Description
- The objective of this project was to develop a fully functional backend system for an e-commerce application.
  Leveraging JavaScript, Node.js, Sequelize, and MySQL2, this application provides users interaction capabilities with an e-commerce database.
  Through the process of building this application, I acquired valuable insights into utilizing Sequelize for database management and Insomnia for API testing.

## Installation
- To run this application, ensure you have Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2, and Sequelize installed.

## Usage
- To initialize the database, use MySQL to source the provided schema. Then, seed the database by running 'node seeds/index.js' in the terminal. Finally, start the server by running 'node server.js'.
